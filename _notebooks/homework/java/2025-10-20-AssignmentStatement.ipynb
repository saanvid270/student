    "If you write int count = \"hello\"; in Java, the program will fail to compile and give an error like “incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int.” This happens because Java is a strongly typed language, and each variable must store only the type of data it was declared to hold. The variable count is declared as an int, which can only store whole numbers, while \"hello\" is a String, which is text. Assigning a string to an integer variable is not allowed. This behavior is helpful because it catches errors before the program runs, preventing bugs such as trying to perform arithmetic on non-numeric data. By enforcing correct data types, Java ensures safer and more predictable code."

    "If a user types \"twenty\" when nextInt() expects a number, the program will throw an InputMismatchException and crash because nextInt() can only read valid integers, and the string \"twenty\" cannot be converted into an integer. To make the program more robust, you can validate user input before attempting to read it as an integer. One common approach is to use a loop with hasNextInt() to check whether the next input is a valid integer. If it is not, the program can prompt the user to enter a number again and discard the invalid input. This prevents the program from crashing and ensures that it only proceeds once a proper integer has been entered, making the program safer and more user-friendly."

    "If a user enters \"San Diego\" when next() is called, only the first word \"San\" gets stored because next() reads input only up to the first whitespace. The remaining text \"Diego\" stays in the input buffer for the next read. In contrast, if nextLine() is used, the entire line \"San Diego\" is read and stored, including spaces, until the user presses Enter. This distinction is important because next() is useful for single-word input, while nextLine() is necessary when you want to capture an entire line of text, such as a full name or a sentence."
