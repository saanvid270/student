# AI Evidence in Work

This week, I reflected on how AI assisted me in my coding and debugging workflow. While I primarily relied on my own original code, AI was occasionally helpful as a **support tool** to identify potential issues or suggest improvements in logic.

---

## Prompts and AI Output

I used AI in specific situations, such as:

- Checking for logical errors or potential bugs in loops  
- Suggesting ways to optimize simple functions  
- Offering explanations of errors that I couldn’t immediately identify  

**Example AI Prompt:**

```text
Prompt: "Why is my Rock-Paper-Scissors game not updating the score correctly when the player wins multiple times in a row? Here is my JavaScript code for the score logic:"
```

**AI Output:**

```js
// AI suggested checking if the score variable is being reset unintentionally
let playerScore = 0;
function play(playerChoice) {
  // ...existing code...
  if (playerWins) {
    playerScore += 1; // Make sure this is outside any reset logic
  }
  // ...existing code...
}
```

> *Example:* When my Rock-Paper-Scissors game wasn’t updating the score correctly in certain rounds, I prompted AI to help me **debug the logic flow**. It provided insights into where the condition checks might fail, which I then applied to my original code.

## My Improvements and Overrides

Even though AI suggested possible fixes, I:

- **Reviewed all suggestions critically** to ensure they aligned with my design goals  
- **Maintained original code structure**, only integrating insights when necessary  
- **Overrode suggestions** when they didn’t fit the experience I wanted to create, such as how user feedback was displayed

**My Improved Code Snippet:**

```js
// filepath: /home/saanv/student/assets/rps.js
let playerScore = 0;
function play(playerChoice) {
  const choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'];
  const computerChoice = choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)];
  let result = '';
  let playerWins = false;

  if (playerChoice === computerChoice) {
    result = "It's a tie!";
  } else if (
    (playerChoice === 'rock' && computerChoice === 'scissors') ||
    (playerChoice === 'paper' && computerChoice === 'rock') ||
    (playerChoice === 'scissors' && computerChoice === 'paper')
  ) {
    result = 'You win!';
    playerWins = true;
  } else {
    result = 'You lose!';
  }

  if (playerWins) {
    playerScore += 1;
    document.getElementById('score').innerText = `Score: ${playerScore}`;
  }

  document.getElementById('result').innerText =
    `You chose ${playerChoice}, computer chose ${computerChoice}. ${result}`;
}
```

> *Reflection:* AI served as a **debugging assistant**, but the **creative and functional design decisions remained my own**. This helped me learn to rely on AI as a tool rather than a replacement for problem-solving.

## Reflection and Learning

Using AI in this way taught me several lessons:

- AI is most effective for **debugging and refining**, not generating original work  
- Keeping the **core logic and design my own** preserves my learning and understanding  
- Thoughtful use of AI can accelerate problem-solving without compromising originality  

By using AI selectively, I was able to **improve my workflow** while ensuring that all core coding and design decisions were entirely my own work.
