# 📜 Manifesto Evidence

This week, I reflected on how **collaborative work** influenced my coding projects and my approach to Learning Experience Design (LxD). Working with peers provided valuable insights that I would not have gained working alone.

## 📝 Peer Review Logs & Joint Commits

During this project, I:

- Participated in **peer review sessions**, providing feedback on others’ code and receiving feedback on my own  
- Made **joint commits** to shared repositories, documenting collaborative improvements  
- Shared **screenshots of working components** to discuss UI, functionality, and user experience  

> ⚡ *Example:* My teammate suggested a simpler way to handle user input validation. Implementing this idea improved the usability of my Rock-Paper-Scissors game and helped me think more carefully about the **learner’s perspective**.

## ✨ Insights from Collaboration

Working with others impacted my approach in several ways:

- **Improved code readability:** Peer feedback encouraged me to write clearer, more maintainable code  
- **Enhanced LxD thinking:** Seeing how others structured feedback loops and UI components helped me design interactions that were **more intuitive and user-friendly**  
- **Encouraged iteration:** Joint commits made it easy to experiment with multiple approaches and learn from immediate feedback  

> 💡 *Reflection:* Collaboration reinforced the idea that **learning experiences benefit from multiple perspectives**. Peers can identify gaps, suggest improvements, and challenge assumptions in ways that enhance both coding and design.

## 🤔 Reflection and Learning

Through collaborative work, I realized:

- Peer review is not just about finding errors — it’s about **sharing insights and improving the overall experience**  
- Working together encourages **flexibility and openness to new approaches**  
- Observing others’ methods gave me **new strategies for creating effective LxD**, particularly around feedback loops and user guidance  

> ✨ *Takeaway:* Collaboration deepened my understanding of both coding and Learning Experience Design, demonstrating how shared effort can lead to stronger, more thoughtful outcomes.
