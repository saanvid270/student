# 🛠 Learning Through Mistakes

This week, I spent a lot of time reflecting on how **mistakes and debugging** played a crucial role in my learning process. While coding projects like my Rock-Paper-Scissors game and frontend experiments were largely successful, I encountered several **unexpected challenges** that tested my problem-solving skills and patience. Each mistake became a lesson, helping me understand not only **technical pitfalls** but also how to approach Learning Experience Design (LxD) with a more careful, user-focused mindset.

---

## Bug Logs & Fix Notes

Some mistakes I encountered this week included:

- **Outdated Python Version:** I realized that I was running an older version of Python required by other applications on my computer. This caused unexpected compatibility issues in my projects, such as scripts failing to execute and certain modules behaving differently. Updating Python to the latest version resolved these issues and reminded me of the importance of keeping my development environment consistent and current.  
- **Syntax Errors and Typos:** Small mistakes like missing colons, incorrect indentation, or typos in variable names caused functions to fail. While these errors were minor, they highlighted the need for careful attention to detail. Logging each instance helped me recognize recurring patterns in my mistakes.  
- **Logic Flow Errors:** In my Rock-Paper-Scissors game, the scoring system occasionally did not update correctly because of misordered condition checks. This forced me to step through each iteration carefully, understanding exactly how the program evaluates each scenario.  
- **UI/UX Oversights:** Early frontend experiments had buttons and interactive elements that weren’t intuitive, such as toggles that didn’t provide feedback or sections that collapsed unexpectedly. These mistakes reinforced the importance of thinking from the user’s perspective, not just the programmer’s.

> *Reflection:* Maintaining a **bug log and fix notes** for every error helped me approach each problem systematically, making it easier to isolate the issue, implement a solution, and record the reasoning behind it.

## Example Code: Before and After Fixes

**Before: Logic Flow Error in Rock-Paper-Scissors (Python)**

```python
# filepath: /home/saanv/student/assets/rps.py
player_score = 0
computer_score = 0

if player_choice == computer_choice:
    print("It's a tie!")
if player_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors":
    player_score += 1
    print("You win!")
elif player_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock":
    player_score += 1
    print("You win!")
elif player_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper":
    player_score += 1
    print("You win!")
else:
    computer_score += 1
    print("You lose!")
```

**Problem:**  
The code above sometimes gave the wrong result because the first `if` for a tie was not connected to the rest of the logic, so both "It's a tie!" and "You lose!" could print.

**After: Corrected Logic Flow**

```python
# filepath: /home/saanv/student/assets/rps.py
player_score = 0
computer_score = 0

if player_choice == computer_choice:
    print("It's a tie!")
elif (player_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
     (player_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock") or \
     (player_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper"):
    player_score += 1
    print("You win!")
else:
    computer_score += 1
    print("You lose!")
```

**Before: UI/UX Oversight in JavaScript Toggle Button**

```js
// filepath: /home/saanv/student/assets/toggle.js
document.getElementById('toggleBtn').onclick = function() {
  const details = document.getElementById('details');
  details.style.display = details.style.display === 'none' ? 'block' : 'none';
};
```

**Problem:**  
There was no feedback to the user about the current state.

**After: Improved Toggle with Feedback**

```js
// filepath: /home/saanv/student/assets/toggle.js
const btn = document.getElementById('toggleBtn');
const details = document.getElementById('details');
btn.onclick = function() {
  if (details.style.display === 'none') {
    details.style.display = 'block';
    btn.textContent = 'Hide Details';
  } else {
    details.style.display = 'none';
    btn.textContent = 'Show Details';
  }
};
```

## Before/After Comparisons

Documenting mistakes allowed me to clearly **see improvements over time**:

- **Before:** Scripts failed silently or threw cryptic errors due to the old Python version. Buttons and toggles behaved unpredictably, leaving users confused.  
- **After:** Updating Python and carefully reviewing code logic ensured scripts executed reliably. Frontend elements became intuitive, with clear feedback and predictable behavior.  
- **Impact on Learning:** Comparing the old versions with the fixed versions highlighted how **small changes, like updating a version or reordering a condition, can drastically improve functionality and user experience**. It also reinforced the value of reflection and documentation as part of the development process.

## Reflection and Lessons Learned

The mistake that taught me the most this week was **using an old Python version**. It reminded me that even a small oversight in tooling can have a **big impact** on progress. Beyond that, the smaller errors — syntax issues, logic errors, and UI oversights — emphasized the importance of **patience, methodical debugging, and attention to detail**.

Other key takeaways included:

- **Environment Awareness:** Always verify that development tools, libraries, and dependencies are up to date before starting a project.  
- **Documentation:** Keeping detailed notes on bugs, fixes, and lessons learned creates a valuable resource for future projects.  
- **Reflection:** Treat mistakes as learning opportunities rather than setbacks; analyzing them systematically builds both skill and confidence.  
- **User-Centered Thinking:** Errors in UI/UX design showed me how vital it is to **anticipate user behavior** and design interactions that are intuitive and forgiving.

> *Takeaway:* Learning through mistakes is not just about fixing code — it’s about cultivating resilience, analytical thinking, and a mindset focused on continuous improvement. Each error this week strengthened my technical skills and deepened my understanding of how to design more thoughtful, user-centered experiences.

Overall, this week reinforced the idea that **mistakes are a powerful tool for growth**. From technical bugs to UX oversights, each challenge became an opportunity to reflect, iterate, and improve both my coding practices and my approach to Learning Experience Design.
