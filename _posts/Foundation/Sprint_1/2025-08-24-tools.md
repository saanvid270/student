## The Student's Toolkit: Setting Up for Success

Welcome to the tools section of my blog! In this post, I'll walk you through my development setup and share some insights on how I've improved my workflow. Whether you're a student or a seasoned developer, having a solid set of tools is crucial.

### Getting Started: My Core Setup

My journey began by setting up Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a versatile and lightweight code editor. The key to making VSCode powerful is its extension ecosystem. I installed extensions for my specific needs, which help with everything from syntax highlighting to running code directly in the editor. To make the most of VSCode, I also connected it to GitHub. This is essential for version control, which allows me to track changes, collaborate with others, and have a backup of all my work.

Speaking of version control, I've come to appreciate the power of Git, the system that powers GitHub. Git works locally on your machine, managing your project's history. GitHub is the online service that hosts your Git repositories, making them accessible from anywhere. The process of getting my project set up was straightforward:

    I cloned a repository from GitHub to my local machine, creating a local copy.

    After making changes, I committed them, which saves the changes to my local Git history.

    Finally, I pushed the changes to the remote repository on GitHub, updating the online version of my project.

This workflow is a powerful way to manage projects and ensures that my work is always up-to-date and backed up.

## Making Sense of Makefiles

Beyond the standard Git and VSCode setup, I also delved into using Makefiles. A Makefile is a set of instructions used to build executable programs and libraries from source code. In my case, it was used to run a local server and build my website. This proved to be an invaluable tool for automating repetitive tasks.
Running a Makefile is as simple as typing make in the terminal. When I needed to see my website locally, a simple make serve command would start a local server. This is a much more efficient process than manually running each command and taught me the importance of task automation.

## Learning and Improving My Workflow

This week, my biggest learning came from a seemingly small but crucial issue: a problem with forking a repository. After some troubleshooting, I realized my mistake was related to not running my environment as an administrator. This simple fix highlighted the importance of attention to detail and a deeper understanding of my operating system's permissions.

This experience taught me that a "tools hack" isn't always about a new piece of software. It can be as simple as understanding a basic command like sudo (which allows you to run commands with superuser privileges), or a fundamental concept like the difference between a local and a deployed server. The difference between the two is that a localhost server is only accessible on your local machine, while a deployed server is accessible globally on the internet.

By understanding these nuances, I've not only solved a problem but also improved the efficiency and stability of my development environment. This continuous process of learning and adapting my toolkit is what makes the journey of coding so rewarding.
